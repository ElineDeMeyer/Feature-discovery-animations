Feature-discovery-animations

Since May Google has updated his Material Design website. I have seen an interesting and cool design pattern in the new section named "Feature discovery" : https://www.google.com/design/spec/growth-communications/feature-discovery.html#feature-discovery-design-patterns. This is a sample to create the same animation.

#Android support

This sample has been made for Android 5+, I don't plan to support old version. But you can use this sample and check these lib to create these animation for Android 4 :
* [CircularReveal](https://github.com/ozodrukh/CircularReveal)
* [ViewRevealAnimator](https://github.com/sephiroth74/ViewRevealAnimator)
